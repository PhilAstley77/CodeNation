    <h1>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>

<P>The purpose of IT in modern business is to make it more efficient primarily to serve a customers needs or the company black line, and not necessarily in that order.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    A company that doesnâ€™t even utilise the basics of IT will spend more in staffing, power, stationery and all the other associated costs of running an office as well as often repeating the same work or having two or more people doing the same job. Take a car lot as a simple example: You would likely have to hire 10 people to run a dealership with all the administration jobs that have to be done such as ground rental, insurance, power, stationery taking orders and processing and banking, advertising and all the while you are accumulating a small forest worth of paperwork all of which could get mislaid requiring hours to locate it again.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Compare this to a basic IT set up, less paperwork, all phone numbers stored on a computer and with the ability to video call, online banking and insurance...the same job can be done with a fraction of the workforce.
