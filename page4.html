    <h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h1>

<P>
        The biggest reason to digital projects failing is mainly a lack of planning or planning in the wrong direction and a lack of resources, if you have budgeted for 50 hours of coding work for something that no reasonable team can do in less than 4x that you are going to run into problems, not least when you can get more resources your original team may have moved on to new projects leaving you to start from scratch again. Some projects are just doomed to fail too, there is currently a trend amongst digital advertisers to be as risque as they can be, the problem with that though is that it can and often does create a negative backlash, causing more damage than if you had actually done nothing.

Another problem that arises is a constant change in direction that causes a project to be delayed to the point that no one cares anymore, and what they do get is so far from what was advertised or hyped that it creates instant negative feedback, Diablo 3 was a project many years in the making that was constantly being pushed back; what we finally got was a mess dominated by an auction house system which only reward DPS with none of the fundamental excellence of its predecessor, a company with a smaller budget would’ve gone under but it took 5 years to fix that game.
