First of all you need to figure out what needs to be done; without a baseline for where you are and where you want to go and the personnel and budgeting constraints working against you and the team as well as where you eventually want to end up you will be running around like headless chickens two weeks into the project until the end. It also has an advantage of setting a clear goal so product creep has a lesser chance of happening; many times a project can over run because someone thought ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…?’

Once you have finished doodling all over a whiteboard or wall there are a couple of tools out there that are really helpful, Trello (which I have recently found out about) lets you break down each task in sequence and assign different people to those tasks, in a cascade of to do, getting done and done as well as any other category you want. It is how I am planning and running this site. Another is Slack so while not in the office you can confer to people, send them notes and schematics without hand delivering and getting lost for three hours.

The most important skill for a project manager is maybe not programming skills or whatever skillset you need to manage, but people skills, finding the right talent for the right job and keeping both motivated and focused as well as having a beady eye on the checkpoints in a project. There are many other skills that could be mentioned but the list would run to the length of Homers Odyssey.
