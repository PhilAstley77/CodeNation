    2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project

    If I had the time I would like to make it easier for mobile users however i do not have a smartphone so would not be able to test this myself at this time; the block of text style I currently have may make it hard to read on small devices at the moment so that can definitely be looked into.

    A thank you page is coming; this is the part which is most often overlooked; you had people on your site, you had a sale or conversion and now it is almost like you are kicking them out of the door without at least a bye-bye. I read once that a simple thank you card for a salesman could convert more sales as it was a surprise to see, eliciting more referral sales. Some people could make it so they didnâ€™t have to cold call anymore, just selling to recommended people.
