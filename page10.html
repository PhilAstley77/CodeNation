    <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
    </h1>
    My website is coming along, I am mainly just writing the content as of now and getting that out of the way and then the beautification of it comes later, I just want to get the content and the links done, if I have time I will make a foreground text box that makes the background transparent and easier to read, edit the css to make my buttons fit with the theme and flex it so that the links are down the side of the site rather than bunched up at the top. I also have a plan to add a splashcard at the end for all the geeks out there to wonder about; this is not a priority though.

    Also to come is some formatting so that my writing down not look all squished into one block, that is a simple case of adding some breaks though, this can be done at the end when everything else is completed.
