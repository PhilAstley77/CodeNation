    <h1>0.1 All about Phil
        </h1>
        My name is Phil and I am 42 years of age, all my life I have lived in small towns doing a multitude of jobs including being a waiter as my first job and which led to doing warehousing and general labouring jobs but this never left me being fulfilled.
        <br>  <br>
        Having left Blackburn with next to no qualifications there werenâ€™t many opportunities but I always have gravitated back to helping people and providing solutions for problems, to this end I found myself selling cheaper gas and electricity door-to-door, working in the call centre in Darwen for TV licensing where I specialised in the Over-75s free licence, particularly as pertains to hunting down their particulars, usually they knew their name and addresses, date of birth but never knew their NI numbers, so they would always end up with the letters asking them to get a tv licence; it was my job to go on the DWP database and use a bit of forensic jiggery pokery to put it all together and finally sort things out for them.
        <br>  <br>
        Later on I found myself as a player moderator for the online game Runescape, and a forum moderator for a related website and later admin. Some time later I found myself a board guide for money saving expert in the technical boards.
        <br>  <br>
        A few years later I decided to leave Blackburn, come to Manchester and sink my teeth into something more worthwhile than carrying boxes from one side of a warehouse to another so the boss could buy another ferrari. Where I go from here is anyones guess but it is going to be interesting to find out!
