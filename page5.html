    <title>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software – the right kind of technology for the job</title>

    <h1>1.5 How do you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>

<P>
        In this instance the best thing to do is get the basics right from the beginning; instead of waiting until you have the perfect set up just find out what you need to make a basic site with some html, coding or css and suchlike and you can adapt and change from there on. If starting a new project and you get everything that happens to be shiny and recommended you will end up with analysis paralysis and feature creep where you just have to use a certain tool because you have it. I am reminded of someone I know who wants to write graphic novels and, rather than selecting multiple tools which he can get for free that does exactly what he wants he just has to have that shiny software package that might save him 40 seconds for £600, add to that graphics software and it gets very expensive very fast even though he hasn’t yet produced anything.

        <br>  <br>

        Cost is obviously a consideration especially if you will need to switch to another more expensive software package down the line, it is always a good idea to find out what file types are supported and if they will be compatible in the future, otherwise months of work will have to either be rewritten or even worse, totally scrapped.
