<P><h1>1.6  Describe and provide analysis on how your
        chosen technologies have helped you achieve
        your outcomes–
        How has trello helped you plan
        and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
        version control?

        Trello is a new project management tool I have only just heard about, in it I can set out what I want to do and break tasks down to their component parts and assign such tasks to certain people and add and remove or move to certain columns such as ‘to do’, ‘doing’ or finally ‘done’ and others of my team can also see who is working on that part of the task. Once when I was in my early 30s I was trying to make websites but the tasks were so large and convoluted that I very quickly got lost, it wasn’t easy to break tasks down and quickly edit what I needed to do versus what was a priority so the whole project very quickly went to hell of analysis paralysis. In trello for instance I could build a site on llamas; and break down the website into subsections of environment, predators and eating habits, mating habits and much more besides so you are always moving forward and are kept on point with a relevant focus. I love it.

        Github as I understand it is similar to Trello however you pull a project to your own server, you modify it and then upload and the systems boss can check it over and then populate their server with the new code without 100s of people constantly modifying the same code; take a big project like the VLC project, something like that would turn into something unmanageable very quickly, with this system incremental improvements could be done in short order for the next patch.
