    <h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trellol</h1>

<P>I have been using trello which really helps break a task down into managable chunks, from the initial design to the content and the CSS coding in the background; it also allows me to add stuff to the board at a later date as thoughts percolate through my head; allowing for a fuller website as time goes on rather than having a massive task at the beginning and not knowing quite where to start. Getting something done even if it is a bit of writing is better than analysis paralysis. I was talking to another student the other day about an example of a website about llamas for example, it can be broken down into environment, predators, mating habits and so on and so forth.

    Github is similar to trello but it focusing more on programming, breaking down a large coding task into smaller chunks that can be assigned to different programmers which can be monitored by a project manager with individual worksheets and outcomes.
    
    Visual Studio Code is really good for editing, syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto indents and much more. With support for hundreds of languages there is not all that much you cannot do with this program. You can also open up your code to review and change with others from your team to help corroboratively. There are so many more benefits it is impossible to list them here, but if you want to do it, likely there is an option for it.

    I have only had one issue really with VSC that couldn’t be resolved, I originally wanted to pull a video from Youtube to autoplay behind my website but for some reason I had a play button and suggested videos; it didn’t work so I had to opt for a simpler background image.
