    <title>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</title>

    <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>

<P>“I love it when a plan comes together.”
<br>

Those immortal lines spoken by George Peppard are not only for building armored jeeps and rocket propelled potato missiles but can also help you define what your website is, who it is going to target, the pages it contains and also where all the myriad of links point to.

<br>
There is an acronym I found on this website and also useful tips going through this process which is P.L.A.N[1]

<br>
Prepare – Identify your target audience, appropriate website tone, and goals.

<br>
Find out who you are going to target; is it for adults, senior citizens, dog lovers or cats bent on world domination? This can also lead on to the tone, when designing for adults in a serious sector such as insurance or mortgages the less a certain talking boxer dog is on the screen the better; to this day I refuse to use a certain site due to a particularly annoying singer. On the other hand a tellytubbies style approach would work for young children that you set up so that young mums and dads can get a little peace to watch the latest episode on Netflix.

<br>
What is the ultimate goal for the website? Is it a blog? A comparison site? A cheap flights aggregator? Or is it a mixture of all?

<br>
Landscape – Think through how you would like your website to be able to function. More specifically, what features need to be on your site?

<br>
A travel site would benefit from a few key components to work well: Local currency exchange values, typical temperature and rainfall for the time of year, and possibly local customs (for instance did you know in Thailand about the worst thing you could do is show the bottom of your feet?) and common words and phrases to help you on your way and well as common costs for local amenities such as taxi travel and buses as well as recommended prices for such.

<br>
Aesthetics - Design aesthetics, or the way your site looks, is a crucial piece of the website creation process.

<br>
On the above example of a travel website a beach view under the text would be a nice addition but you also have to be mindful of the text colour and how readable it is. You also should avoid too many video adverts or sidebars as these can be overly distracting.

<br>
Navigation - Website navigation is the way the website pages and links are organized.

<br>
On a news site you will generally find local news, international, science and tech and sports in their own particular area; if your site is a large shopping ecommerce site and your computer department link sends you off to buy white knickers while you may be amused you will likely head off to a competitor quicker than you site takes to load.
