    <h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </h1>
        To the risk of repeating myself the benefits of IT tools is incalculable, work can be assigned and checked off however if you are working on your own with multiple windows and tools open you can end up just flitting back and forth of VSC and trello, spending more time mapping out what needs doing rather than actually doing it. In this case for projects it might be a good idea for one person to take on the task of reviewing and updating what needs doing and assigning tasks while updating things such as links and some css background. I myself can write so would find myself taking on that role, there is someone in our intake who is a natural when it comes to coding and others who are good at planning. A team in that sense might get more done but only if the division of labour is equal.
