    <h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h1>
    
    The Visual Studio Code was excellent for what it allows you do, if writing background code on any other medium you have to work within its constraints, I havenâ€™t yet found any for VSC...if I wanted I feel I could use it to make my own websites in time with really powerful options and not just from a design background; if I had any hope of taking on Amazon I could probably do that too!
    <br><br>
    Trello is far superior to old school pen and paper, those tend to get lost behind the fridge and it is not easy to update and edit tasks as they become needed with deadlines and suchwhat; if doing it oldschool you would quickly end up spending more time writing out what you need to do and organising everything that nothing would ever get done. I am reminded of the Red Dwarf book in which Rimmer has a geography exam but then spends so much time messing around with his timetables for study he only ends up with two hours left to study after months of scheduling. I think he had a breakdown in the end and decided he was a fish.
