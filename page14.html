    <h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
    </h1>
    Next time I would definitely use teamwork in the case of one person writing while another is prettifying the site and making it functional and another is coming up behind and making sure everything is working as it should, links going where they are meant to be going, not dying and not completely disappearing into the ether (as I have got right now admittedly due to my mistake covered on the previous pages.

    There has not been much use for slack in this project as it is very much individual though I suppose it could help in the future when the team is spread out over a large office area which would negate the need for running all over the place to chase things up.
