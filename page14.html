    <h1>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h1>
First of all I would figure out how I want the site to run and look, get all the content written and put on my page and then go through each page making sure the links work how I want and they go where I want them to go. Earlier I had a fun time making pages for my site but forgot to save them individually as html pages so ended up saving a page of nothing over already complated pages. Nightmare! It is fixed now though it is something to remember for the future.
