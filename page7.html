<h1>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1>

        GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is basically a set of guidelines for the protection of customer data and what happens to it and who can access it. The biggest problem though is that there is no real guideline to how this can be achieved, beyond telling all sites to spam customers or browsers with opt in click buttons (funnily enough there is next to no opt out). All this achieves is a much protracted session of every site you go on making you wade through dozens of notifications every day. A cookie in computing is in effect just like a shopping bag telling other sites what you may be interested in based on what you search; there is no real reason you have to be told about them on every site you go into. If a customer is hammered every time they go anywhere they are much more likely to walk away leading to a potential drop in revenue.
